# OpenClassrooms_Distributed_computing

This project aims at discovering distributed computing and cloud computing with the EC2 service of AWS and Big Data.

The final goal is to classify fruits based on pictures, however we simply set the first steps of the process chain (feature extraction from the pictures using the VGG16 pre-trained CNN and dimension reduction) on a small sample of pictures.

We use here Pyspark so that the algorithm is ready for distributed computing in order to support larger data volume.
